## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)

**The Project in a tweet**

A b2b service for remote teams

**Why its relevant**

Remote work is great. But it comes at a cost: social connections.

Team leaders in the modern remote working environment have a lot on their to do list and can spend the time researching remote team building information doing more useful work for their core business. This is why I created a service for remote teams to connect and engage easier by delivering a bespoke remote team playbook.

**Target audience**

Team Leader + HR / Peoples Managers

**Timeframe**

05/2021 - 10/21 

**Traffic / Stats**
[Plausible Data ](https://plausible.io/remotenactive.com?period=custom&from=2021-05-03&to=2021-10-25             

I then switched to a CMS-based Website with Ghost as this was the fastest way to manage user-management & payment.
