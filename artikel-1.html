                   If you work with a remote team, you know what it's like to have a constant communication challenge. 

                   If you're in a global team, it's even more difficult. 
                   
                   No matter how hard you work to stay in touch, it's tough to feel like you're on the same page. 
                   
                   As a team leader, what's your strategy for managing your remote team? </p>
                   <p class="leading-loose text-lg mb-4">
                   Here are tips for remote teams that we've learned along the way.</p>
                  <p class="leading-loose text-lg mb-4 font-bold">Stay in touch with your remote team</p>
                  <p class="leading-loose text-lg mb-4">
                  Working remote does not mean losing the line.

                  Which is why it is crucial to stay in touch with your team.
                  
                  These 4 things we've learned help make remote teams feel like they're in the same room as the rest of the team. 
                  
                 <p class="leading-loose text-lg mb-4 font-bold">1. Align your goals</p> 
                 <p class="leading-loose text-lg mb-4"> 
                  Most remote teams have some shared objectives. 
                  
                  But unless you do a lot of focused planning, communication issues will arise. 
                  
                  If you talk about things in the abstract, you'll end up talking past each other. 
                  
                  Communication has to come with a goal in mind. 
                  
                  This helps clarify the purpose of what you're communicating, and clarify what needs to be done. 
                  
                  By sharing your goals, you'll all be in sync when you're speaking to each other. 
                  
                  If the objective is e.g. to create a new video, you all know what that means. 
                  
                  You can find out who has the most experience. 
                  
                  You can come up with a plan for production. 
                  
                  You can negotiate workflows that work for everybody. <br>
                
                  E.g. by making use of templates, <a class="text-purple-700 text-decoration: underline" href="https://www.notion.so/Video-production-d4dd7cae3ec848b78f70e993fd76011d">like this one from notion.</a>

                <img src="/SEO/article images/notion-video-production.png" alt="">
                <p class="leading-loose text-lg mb-4">
                  But what if the overall goal is not that clear?

                  For example, the video "does not feel in line with the target audience" ? <br>
                  
                  Then you have to break the objectives into manageable chunks by tracking your goals.
                  
                  <p class="leading-loose text-lg mb-4 font-bold">2. Track your goals</p>
                  <p class="leading-loose text-lg mb-4"> 
                  A popular method to do this is the "OKR"-Method, or <span class="font-bold">Objectives and Key Results</span> , popularized by Google.
                  <br>
                  Get started with your OKR-planning with <a class="text-purple-700 text-decoration: underline" href="https://www.notion.so/OKRs-32cf0d3923e545dfbe45e415a675ece1" >this notion template</a>
                  
                  <p class="leading-loose text-lg mb-4 font-bold">3. Show your team you care</p>
                  <p class="leading-loose text-lg mb-4">
                  One of the main challenges of not sharing the same work space is that finished work can float away in a sea of not-noticingness.
                  
                  To prevent this it is very important that the team members know when you appreciate the work they have done.
                  
                  A simple Gif in a Slack Channel, or an uplifting compliment in the working documents will show your team that you see and care about their work.
                </p>
                <p class="leading-loose font-style: italic mb-4">"🎉👍 Great work with the OKR-Planning, Jean!"</p>

                </p>
                  <p class="leading-loose text-lg mb-4 font-bold">4. Talk about things not related to work</p>
                  <p class="leading-loose text-lg mb-4"> 
                  Just as you have casual conversations in the lift, or at the coffee machine about the weather, current sport events, or the newest hot topics from the yellow press, talk to your team about things not related to work once in a while.
                  
                  This lightens up the mood and supports you in getting a feeling of what are topics your team members care about.
                  <br>
                  All these activities might become a burden if you have to do them manually on a day-to-day basis.
                  
                  That is why you can make your life much easier by letting apps and tools take over some painful tasks.
