            <strong> What are cookies? </strong> <br>

             <p> As usual with almost all professional websites, this website uses cookies, tiny files that are downloaded to your computer to make visiting a website more comfortable or safer.
                Cookies can also be used to better tailor the offer on a website to the interests of the visitors or to improve it in general on the basis of statistical evaluations. <br>

                This page describes what information cookies collect, how we use it and why we sometimes need to save these cookies.
                We will also tell you how you can prevent these cookies from being stored.
                Please note that the functionality of websites may be restricted or even disabled if cookies are not allowed.

                <strong> How we use cookies </strong>
                <br> <br>
                We use cookies for a variety of reasons, which are detailed below.
                Unfortunately, in most cases there are no industry-standard options for generally disabling cookies.
                The reason for this is that some functions and features that add cookies to a website can be completely deactivated.
               
                <br> <br>
                <strong> Deactivate cookies </strong>
                <br> <br>
                You can prevent cookies from being set by adjusting the settings in your browser; you can find information on this in the help of your browser. <br>
